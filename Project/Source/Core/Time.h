\class Time
\brief
  This static class is responsible for managing the values associated with frame
  times and program ticks. It will store the amount of time passed since it was
  previously updated and other important information related to program time.

\par Important Notes
  - Update this class at the very start of each frame so all other functionality
    uses the proper time values.

  \class Stopwatch
  \brief
    Stopwatches are time instances that keep track of their own total time.
    They can be used to pause time and the total time passed for the Stopwatch
    will not change. They can also be used to speed up, slowdown, or reverse
    time using the timeScale value that is applied to the delta time of a
    single frame.

  \par Important Notes
    - Once you create a Stopwatch, you do not need to update it. The time
      class will take care of that assuming that the stopwatch you are using
      lasts longer than a single frame.
